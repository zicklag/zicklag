### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm @zicklag, an Open Source enthusiast who dreams of making video games with Rust. The most important thing in my life is my God and Father to whom I owe everything.

I'm the Chief Technology Lead at [Katharos Technology](https://katharostech.com/), where I do most of my development. I love making tools that people will love to use and I enjoy making nice user interfaces.

### What I'm Working On

With Katharos Technology I develop the [Bevy Retro](https://github.com/katharostech/bevy_retro) game library in support of our first demo game, [Bounty Bros](https://katharostech.com/post/bounty-bros-on-web). I contribute to lots of different Open Source projects as I have time, usually in an effort to supply what we need for game development at Katharos Tech.

### What Would I Love to Make ( Though I Probably Won't Ever Get the Chance )

- An beautiful and easy-to-use digital audio workstation that works great for recording and for synthesizing
- A Linux desktop environment or theme that makes you feel super-cool and smart because it looks like it came out of a science fiction movie 

### Contact ðŸ“¨

You can contact me directly on any of the forums I'm on such as the [Rust users forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/zicklag/summary) or the [Amethyst forum](https://community.amethyst.rs/u/zicklag/summary).

If you have questions or are interested in what we are doing at Katharos Technology, you can [contact us](https://katharostech.com/contact) on our website.
