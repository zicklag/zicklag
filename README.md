### Hi there 👋

I'm @zicklag, an Open Source enthusiast who dreams of making video games 🎮 ( who doesn't right? ) with Rust 🦀 ( ← Amazing ✨ ). The most important thing in my life is my God and Father to whom I owe everything.

I'm the Chief Technology Lead at [Katharos Technology](https://katharostech.com/), where I do most of my development 🦸. I love making tools that people will love to use and I enjoy making nice user interfaces, with [Juju Lens](https://github.com/katharostech/juju-lens) and [Katharostech.com](https://katharostech.com) being the best UI projects I've made ( Powered by [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/)! ). Our design motto at KatharosTech is "user experience first" and I really try to make sure that my solutions are full of user experience awesomeness 🙂.

### 🎮 What I'm Working On 🕹

With Katharos Technology I hope to develop the [Arsenal game engine](https://github.com/katharostech/arsenal) so that we can create the best user experience of any game engine out there 💪 while building on [Blender](https://blender.org) and providing mind blowing performance through the power of Rust and the entity component system ( ECS ) design model 🏗️.

If you love Rust, Open Source, Games, Blender, High Performance, and amazing User Experience, you can [sponsor Arsenal development](https://github.com/sponsors/katharostech/) on GitHub.
