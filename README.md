### Hi there 👋

I'm @zicklag, an Open Source enthusiast who dreams of making video games with Rust 🦀. The most important thing in my life is my God and Father to whom I owe everything.

I'm the Chief Technology Lead at [Katharos Technology](https://katharostech.com/), where I do most of my development. I love making tools that people will love to use and I enjoy making nice user interfaces, with [Juju Lens](https://github.com/katharostech/juju-lens) and [Katharostech.com](https://katharostech.com) being the best UI projects I've made. Our design motto at KatharosTech is "user experience first" and I really try to make sure that my solutions are full of user experience awesomeness 🙂.

### What I'm Working On 🕹

With Katharos Technology I develop the [Arsenal game engine](https://github.com/katharostech/arsenal) so that we can create the best user experience of any game engine out there while building on [Blender](https://blender.org) and providing mind blowing performance through the power of Rust and the entity component system ( ECS ) design model.

If you love Rust, Open Source, Games, Blender, High Performance, and amazing User Experience, you can [sponsor Arsenal development](https://opencollective.com/arsenal) on Open Collective.
 
 ### Contact 📨

You can contact me directly on any of the forums I'm on such as the [Rust users forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/zicklag/summary) or the [Amethyst forum](https://community.amethyst.rs/u/zicklag/summary).

If you have questions or are interested in what we are doing at Katharos Technology, you can [contact us](https://katharostech.com/contact) on our website.
